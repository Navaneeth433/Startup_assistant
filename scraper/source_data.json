SBIRI was the first of its kind, early-stage, innovation-focused PPP initiative in the area of Biotechnology. The launching of SBIRI has worked as an enabling platform for the target organizations to realize their potential in terms of product and process development and taking them to the market. It has facilitated innovation, and risk-taking by small and medium companies and brought together the private industry, public institutions, and the government under one roof to promote the research and innovation in the Indian Biotech Sector. The projects supported under the scheme have resulted in prominent outcomes in the form of some products which have already come to the market and some promising research leads seeing a ray of hope for commercialization."
